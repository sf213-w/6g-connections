US Department of State,Sweden-US Cooperation,MOU,"The Swedish and US governments have signed a bilateral deal to work together on developing 6G technologies. The two stated that international cooperation, including partnerships with the private sector, is crucial for developing open and interoperable technologies like open radio access networks and sustainable 6G. They added that this approach aims to ensure that 6G is resilient, secure, safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and sustainable, as highlighted in the Joint Statement Endorsing Principles for 6G and the US-EU Trade and Technology Council’s 6G Vision. 

The agreement will see the countries identifying synergies and exploring possibilities to create a joint ecosystem for research and development in 6G technology and applications by making use of new spectrum allocations by future wireless services/technologies and introducing new technologies in existing frequency bands.  The two will also encourage global harmonization of frequency bands for 6G and next generations wireless services.   

The two will explore possibilities for long-term research collaboration, including potential funding for relevant bilateral research collaboration, in many areas related to 6G and beyond, including: resiliency, security, trust and privacy; machine learning and AI-enabled technologies; efficient use of communication and computing resources, materials, cybersecurity, edge computing, algorithms, distributed intelligence, and data resources; attaining sustainability; addressing spectrum issues; and encouraging the joint use and establishment of test beds, open architectures, advanced micro-electronics, dynamic spectrum management, optical science and network and computer science.

NTT DoCoMo,Indoor 6G at 4.8GHz,EVENT,"NTT DOCOMO, INC., working in cooperation with NTT Corporation, Nokia and SK Telecom Co., Ltd., an international telecommunications operator, announced today that in an indoor test*1 *2 with radio waves in the 4.8Ghz band of 6G wireless technology using AI for the first time in Japan, *3 *4 *5 they confirmed that communication speeds can be improved up to 18% compared to conventional methods indoors.

Moving towards the era of 6G, DOCOMO conducted the test with NTT, Nokia and SK Telecom, using AI technology to optimize transmission and reception processing for various radio wave propagation environments.

Specifically, the test confirmed that communication performance can be improved by using AI-based baseband transmission and reception processing developed by Nokia to design optimum modulation schemes according to the radio wave propagation environment and applied it to a wireless interface. In addition, the reception process using AI does not use a known signal*6 between the transmitter and receiver (reference signal), which is conventionally needed to estimate the propagation channel, but instead uses AI to realize a series of reception processes from channel estimation to signal detection in one step. The result is higher transmission efficiency and improved communication speeds (see figure).",Commercial,,2024.0,JP,2024-11-20

ETSI,Multiple Access Techniques ISG,PROGRAM,"ETSI has established a new Industry Specification Group (ISG) focused on Multiple Access Techniques (MAT) for 6G mobile systems. The group aims to build industry consensus on numerous multiple-access techniques based on 3GPP specifications.

The ISG MAT will explore candidate techniques such as Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) that enhance the transmission efficiency across parameters such as spectrum efficiency, power consumption, latency and user fairness. Relevant deployment environments considered in the ISG MAT are indoor hotspot, urban macro (e.g., High Demand Density areas), and rural settings. The ISG MAT will concentrate on downlink multiple access techniques for the physical layer of the 3GPP radio interface.

ETSI launched the ISG MAT on 15-16 January 2025, at a meeting in London attended by 24 participants from industry, academia, and government administrations. The group elected its leadership with Dr. David Vargas from the BBC as chair, Prof. Bruno Clerckx from Imperial College London, and Dr. Stephen Wang from VIAVI Solutions as vice chairs.

“Multiple Access Techniques are at the core of mobile technology development and are considered as a key technology to enhance the radio interface for IMT-2030 systems,” said Vargas. “We are excited to launch the ISG MAT and bring together industrial and academic members and play a crucial role in accelerating the development of advanced Multiple Access Techniques for 6G mobile systems.”",Research,,2025.0,,2025-01-28

Nokia,6G Semantic Communications,PARTNERSHIP,"South Korean telecommunications giant KT said Monday it is joining hands with Nokia Bell Labs Core Research to advance research and commercialization of semantic communication technology for the 6G era.

Semantic communication is a next-generation technology that uses artificial intelligence to interpret the meaning and context of data, transmitting only essential information rather than every raw data element.

This approach is expected to improve network efficiency dramatically and enable services such as fully autonomous driving, remote robotics and immersive holographic communications, KT said.

“Semantic communication is an innovative technology that will redefine the very role of networks by fusing AI and communications,” said Lee Jong-sik, executive vice president and head of KT’s Future Network Research Institute.

Since October last year, KT said it has been conducting internal demonstrations of semantic communication in the high-data-consumption areas of video and voice communications, which are the most noticeable to customers.

The tests confirmed that semantic communication can deliver the intended meaning of the original data while significantly reducing transmission volume, without degrading the quality perceived by the user.",Commercial,,2025.0,US,2025-06-30

LG Electronics,Future 2030 Summit,EVENT,"LG Electronics has begun discussions to secure technological leadership with industry-academia-research experts in future core technology fields such as 6G, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum, and the space industry.

On the 24th, at the LG Electronics Seocho R&D Campus in Seocho-gu, Seoul, LG Electronics held the “Future 2030 Summit” with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). It is a technology exchange event to share the status of research and development in future technology fields and to discuss future direction by exchanging technology goals, promising technologies, and application and service outlooks.

Since 2022, LG Electronics has held the 6G Grand Summit, a technology exchange event, with KAIST and KRISS. Starting this year, it expanded the topics to include ▲ physical AI ▲ quantum technology (Quantum-X) ▲ space industry technology (Space Tech). The plan is to further strengthen the industry-academia-research collaboration built so far and seize leadership in rapidly changing future technology fields.

At the event, Executive Vice President Kim Byung-hoon, chief technology officer (CTO) of LG Electronics, KAIST President Lee Kwang-hyung, KRISS Vice President Park Yeon-gyu, and Science and ICT Ministry Office for Science, Technology and Innovation Head Park In-kyu delivered welcome and congratulatory remarks. In addition, national government-funded research institute experts and academia experts, including Cho Dong-ho and KAIST Professor Hong Sung-chul, who serve as former and current heads of the LG Electronics-KAIST 6G Research Center, attended in large numbers to give technology presentations and hold exhibitions and demonstrations.

KAIST Professor Jang Young-jae and Masahiro Horibe of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) delivered keynote speeches on building a manufacturing industry ecosystem through physical AI and on Japan’s quantum strategy and ecosystem building.

Various future technology demonstrations were also held. LG Electronics unveiled ▲ a new 6G FDR (full duplex radio, full-duplex mobile) solution that can maximize frequency efficiency ▲ a solution that uses P5G communication technology to precisely control numerous robots in a smart factory in real time without interruption ▲ a next-generation voice communication solution that enables voice calls even in areas with poor network connectivity, such as deserts and mountainous regions, by using a non-terrestrial network (IoT-NTN) operated outside the atmosphere, such as on satellites.

Alongside this, demonstrations by KAIST and KRISS of ▲ AI Semiconductor-based robots ▲ a robot-based 6G wireless radio wave measurement system and spatial multi-mode transceiver ▲ exhibitions of software solutions for quantum computers and Quantum Computing materials development also drew interest.

Starting with the establishment in 2019 of Korea’s first 6G industry-academia research center, the “LG Electronics-KAIST 6G Research Center,” LG Electronics has built a cooperation belt with domestic and overseas universities and research institutes to secure fundamental 6G technologies. Based on this, the company plans to apply 6G technologies—capable of immersive, lifelike content transmission and combining communications with AI and sensing—to various fields being fostered as future growth engines, such as AI home, mobility, and smart factories.",Commercial,,2025.0,KR,2025-10-26
